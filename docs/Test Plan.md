### Test specification
This section shows the different levels of testing performed during the software development process. It includes integrations and system tests performed by the team members to verify that the system fulfills the requirements and performs as expected. The complete testing procedures are outlined in the test specifications document.

### Test Reports
Test reports offer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. The reports in this testing exercise track incidents, defects, and changes while testing the system.

## Items and Features tested

### Website
The website is tested at the end of each big developement phase, small testings will be also executed during software developement. During the test the team will test selected part of the software and check the results with the requirements.
