## 1 OVERVIEW
### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
All the users of the Webserver will have a quick way to access all the utilities of the school. Using the Campus account credentials students will be able to access to all the private utilities invisible otherwise like the school timetable and the private news.
The Webserver will work with every updated browser and could be used also with smarthphones and tablets.
The user interface will be intuitive and simple to navigate, with 100% of new users being able to use the Webserver without referencing the user manual.
At the minimum , the software will allow users to wiew the Marconi Timetable, connect to the Spaggiari register, Campus Marconi website, Bar Poldo website, Timap website and Fantamarconi website. Users could use a login interface to access to private areas and view private news.
### 1.2 Goals and Objectives
The overall goal is to give students, parents and teachers an alternative way to access all the school's utilities. 
The website is expected to: 
* Provide a web interface where students can access services using Campus Marconi credentials.  
* Giving students, teachers and parents a place where they have grouped all the services provided by the school.
### 1.3 Project Deliverables

24/10/2019 - Requirements Specification
07/11/2019 - Project Plan and Iteration #1 Plan
19/12/2019 - Iteration #1 Complete and delivery of the first prototype
09/01/2020 Iteration #2 Plan
23/04/2020 Iteration # 2 Complete
30/04/2020 Testing of the project
14/05/2020 Product Released

### 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints
#### 1.4.1 Assumptions
In the first iteration the website will work only by accessing from a computer obviously connected to internet.
#### 1.4.2 Constraints
Approval is required from the teachers and the school to make this project official.
### 1.5 Budget Summary
#### 1.5.1 Cost Estimate
None
### 1.6 Success Criteria
The project will be considered succesful if the minimum functionalities and the login section will work completely at the end of the school year.
## 2 Startup Plan
### 2.1 Team Organization

| Role | Actor(s) | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Manager | Matteo |Coordinate communications inside and outside group and assign work to teammates. |
| Developer and programmer | Matteo, Riccardo C., Riccardo S. | Develop and program software based on requirements. |
| Designer | Tommaso | Specify overall visual design of the project and create all media necessary to the project. |
| Tester | Matteo, Riccardo C., Tommaso, Riccardo S. | Write test cases and perform testing of test cases, report issues. |
### 2.2 Project Communications

| Event | Information | Audience | Format | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Team Meeting | Task status: completed since last week & planned for next week, obstacles encountered, change requests in process | All team members |Informal meetings | As needed |
| Project Status Report | Review finished items, status of prototype; review any problems, schedule slippage, programming issues | All team members, customer | Formal meeting and multimedia presentation | Iteration Closeout |

### 2.3 Technical Process
An iterative and incremental development process is planned.  Feedback will be used from each iteration to improve the next.  The first iteration will focus on basic functionality of the application.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features as time allows.
2.4 Tools
* Programming & Markup Languages -  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
* Operating System - Windows
* Version Control - all work products will be stored in a GitHub repository

## 3 Work Plan
### 3.1 Resource Estimate
In this document, tasks, roles, owners, and effort estimates & actuals are listed.
### 3.2 Release Plan
#### 3.2.1 Plan by Feature
**Iteration 1:** 24/10/2019 - 19/12/2019

**Summary:** Demonstrate fundamental architecture and design,   
each section except the timetable section working.

| Features/Deliverables | Estimated effort | Actual Effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture and overall design | 40 | 40 |
| Functioning sections | 50 | 70 |
**Iteration #2:** 09/01/2020 - 23/04/2020
**Summary:** Login section and private area functioning, orario section functioning.
| Features/Deliverables | Estimated effort | Actual Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Login section and private area| 50||
|Timetable section|70||
### 3.3 Iteration Plans
#### 3.3.1 First Interation
Each section except the timetable section working. Users are able to access all the utilities of the school available in the public area.
#### 3.3.2 Second Interation and Final Product
The login section and the private area will properly work showning timetable section and private news.
## 4 Control Plan

### 4.1 Monitoring and Control

The following list of dates includes formal reviews outside of the Communication Plan.  Milestones are included to reference where the project is scheduled to stand as these reviews occur:
| Date | Review / Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 24/10/2019 | Milestone: Overall design complete |
| 19/12/2019 | Milestone: Iteration #1 Complete<br>Delivery of the first prototype |
| 23/04/2020 | Milestone: Iteration # 2 Complete |
| 14/05/2020 | Milestone: Product Released<br>Final presentation |
### 4.2 Configuration mangement Plan
The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work products:

1.  All project work products will be stored in a centralized GitHub repository.
2.  All baselined documents will have a section with a change history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
3.  All project work products (documents, source code, test cases, program data, test data, etc) will be stored in the GitHub repository.
5.  The change control procedure once a product is baselined is:
* anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the team and project sponsor (i.e. Professor Drago, Professor Bileddo) describing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and time line for integrating the change.
* if no one responds to the group within 7 days with a reason for why the change request shouldn't be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.

* if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should be allowed.

* if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project manager to update the schedule.

## 5 Supporting Process Plans
### 5.1 Risk Management Plan
| Rank | Risk | Probability of Loss | Size of Loss | Risk Esposure | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Schedule / time line delivery | Likely | Major | High | Mitigate: Stick to the schedule. |
| 2 | Learning curve for new tools and technologies longer than expected | Unlikely | Moderate | Moderate | Begin working on a basic prototype to test fundamental programming concepts & knowledge .|
### 5.2 Test Plan
The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and time line.
The test plan will be available in a separate document in the version control system at: [https://github.com/Fr0stBob/2020-5Ai-team7-Corsi/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/Fr0stBob/2020-5Ai-team7-Corsi/tree/master/docs)
### 5.3 Product Acceptance Plan
At the conclusion of each iteration, the prototype created will tested to ensure it meets the requirements of that iteration.

For the final iteration, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype functions as expected with a user's data.
