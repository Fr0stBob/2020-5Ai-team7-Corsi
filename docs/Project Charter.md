|**Assumptions:** In the first iteration the website will work only by accessing from a computer obviously connected to internet.|
|**Success Criteria:** The project will be considered succesful if the minimum functionalities and the login section will work completely at the end of the school year.|
|**Scope:** At the minimum , the software will allow users to wiew the Marconi Timetable, connect to the Spaggiari register, Campus Marconi website, Bar Poldo website, Timap website and Fantamarconi website. Users could use a login interface to access to private areas and view private news.|
|**Risks and obstacles to success:** A risk the team faces is the lack of experience in developing websites. We do not yet have a clear picture of how every single functionality will be implemented.|
