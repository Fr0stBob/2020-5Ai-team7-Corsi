**Document Owner**
Convertino Riccardo is responsible for developing and maintaining this document.

## 1 Introduction
The Team 7 architecture document was designed to illustrate and identify the high-level architecture systems used to design and implement the Web Server application. The document contains an overview of the classification of the components used.

## 2 Components Classification
### 2.1 Presentation Layer
**Purpose:** To display forms, controls and images to the user to create a fluid and efficient user experience.

**Specific Nature:** The presentation layer will be in charge of displaying appropriate images and menus to the user. When a user clicks a menu on the GUI, the code corresponding to that event will be called. This layer will also be in charge of the spawning of appropriate threads. The need of spawning extra threads is due to the fact that the main thread of the app will be watching for event clicks, but we also need another thread constantly running to get the users current position.  

**Subcomponents:** Image Viewer **â€“** That it is used during the Walking Tour and during the Interactive Map mode of the application. Its responsibility is to display the appropriate image as determined by the Landmark held in the Current State.

### 2.1 Database Layer
**Purpose:** This layer is in charge of storing data in persistent storage.

**Specific Nature:** This layer will consist of SQL files. These together will be our database management system. These SQL files will store all the data needed for the application.

### 2.1 Data interaction Layer
**Purpose:** This level is used to pass data from the database to the application.

## 3 Design Goal

Our priorities for the design are:

- The project must minimize complexity and development effort.

- The project must take into account the development environment, which consists of 1 small team with complementary skills working in time and space. Ideally, the project should lead to 3-4 components of equal size and complexity. If the components have well-defined interfaces each team member can work independently by coding the interfaces of the other components. The concerns of each component should be narrowed down so that each member can specialize in a particular technology or skill.

# Coding Standards

## 1 Source file basics

###  1.1 File name
The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the scope of the file, plus the extension.
###  1.2 File Encoding: UTF-8
Source files are encoded in **UTF-8**.

## 2 Source file structure
A source file consists of, **in order**:
1. License or copyright information, if present
2. Package statement
3. Import statements
4. Contents of the file depending on the extension

### 3.1 License or Copyright information, if present
If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.

### 3.2 License or Copyright information, if present
The package statement is **not line-wrapped**.

### 3.3 Import statements

#### 3.3.2 No line-wrapping
Import statements are **not line-wrapped**.

#### 3.3.3 Ordering and spacing
Imports are ordered as follows:
1. All imports in a single block.

If there are both static and non-static imports, a single blank line separates the two blocks. There are no other blank lines between import statements.

## 4 Line-Wrapping
When code that might otherwise legally occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is called _line-wrapping_.

There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing _exactly_ how to line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.

## 5 Braces are used where optional
Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.

## 6 Block indentation: +4 spaces
Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by four spaces.
When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.
